Hacktoberfest is the easiest way to get into open source! Hacktoberfest is a month long festival of open source code presented by [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV](https://www.dev.to/) this year in 2023.

During the entire month of October 2022, all you have to do is contribute to any open source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contributions. It can be a be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change! And win a T-Shirt and awesome stickers.

> You Can Upload Coded Projects In the Codes Directory 

```py
'''
Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get digital-swags.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
